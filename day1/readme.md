# 📘 Day 1: Introduction to Python – CodingGen Challenge

Welcome to Day 1 of the 15-Day Python Challenge by *CodingGen*!  
Today, we’re covering the foundation of Python — from installation to writing your first line of code.

---

## 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.

- Simple and beginner-friendly  
- Highly readable (almost like English!)  
- One of the most popular languages in tech  

---

## 🛠 Applications of Python

Python is used in:

- Web Development (Django, Flask)  
- Data Science & Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)  
- Automation & Scripting  
- Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking  
- Game Development  
- App Development  
- Internet of Things (IoT)

## ⚙ Setting Up Python

You have two beginner-friendly options:

1. *Install Python* from: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)  
2. *Use Google Colab*: A browser-based IDE (no setup needed)

## ✅ First Python Program

python
print("Hello, Python Learner!")


📤 Output:  

Hello, Python Learner!


---

## 📦 Variables and Data Types

Variables store information in Python.

python
name = "Alex"       # str  
age = 25            # int  
height = 5.9        # float  
is_student = True   # bool


### Data Types:
- str: Text (e.g. "Hello")  
- int: Whole numbers  
- float: Decimal numbers  
- bool: True or False  

---

## 🎤 Input and Output

python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello", user_name)


📤 If you type Sam, Python will output:  

Hello Sam

## 🗒 Comments in Python

Use comments to explain code.

python
# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a
multi-line comment
'''


---

## 🧠 Naming Conventions

Do:
- Use lowercase with underscores (user_name)  
- Keep variable names descriptive  

Avoid:
- Starting names with numbers  
- Special characters like %, $, @
